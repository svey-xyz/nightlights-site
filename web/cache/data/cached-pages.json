Remixing techniques and textures, VanderMeulen uses collage, painting, and digital 3D modelling tools to provoke the subconscious and challenge perceptions of reality. Ethereal landscapes are created as effervescent entrances; lifting the viewer into a deeper inner state of mind and prompting a sifting-through of the longings we feel in our day-to-day lives.\nDiana is a multidisciplinary artist based in Toronto and holds a BFA from York University. She navigates new digital tools creating both moving and still imagery with highly detailed resolutions. Her most recent work is an Augmented-Reality experience titled Swampy GoGo, which extends from a series of 2D mixed media landscapes. Utilizing new media technology, Diana expands the lifespan and audience of durational immersive installations and location specific artworks. Alongside a collaborative representation with Sky Fine Foods, VanderMeulen has been involved in many public and DIY ventures.
